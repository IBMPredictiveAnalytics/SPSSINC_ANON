<p>This command replaces the values of the specified variables with new values
according to one of three methods.  It is intended for situations where the
true values must be concealed for privacy or other reasons.  It can also
replace the variables names with anonymous equivalents.</p>

<p><strong>VARIABLES</strong> specifies the list of variables to anonymize.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>METHOD</strong> specifies how to generate the new values. The choices are</p>

<ul>
<li>SEQUENTIAL replaces each value with a sequential number.  If a value
recurs for a variable, it gets the same number.</li>
<li>RANDOM replaces the values with a random integer in the range 0 to MAXRVALUES inclusive.<br/></li>
<li>TRANSFORM, which applies only to numeric variables, calculates a new value
according to the formula OFFSET + SCALE &#42; <em>value</em>.  If TRANSFORM is
specified and the variable list includes strings, SEQUENTIAL will be used
for those variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>System-missing values are treated as the same value across cases, and for
TRANSFORM, the new value will also be system missing.</p>

<p><strong>MAXRVALUES</strong>, which applies only to the RANDOM method, can be a single integer
applied to all variables or a list of as many integers as there are variables being
anonymized.  For string variables, the range is further limited by the declared
string width.</p>

<p>TRANSFORM and SEQUENTIAL will produce unique values as long as, in the case
of SEQUENTIAL with string variables, the field is wide enough.  For RANDOM,
you can specify a list of one or more variables as ONETOONE, which will
generate unique values if that is possible.  If unique values cannot be generated, the
procedure will stop with an error message.  Using ONETOONE increases the time and
memory requirements.</p>

<p>For repeatability, you can specify a numerical value for <strong>SEED</strong> that will produce the
same results if the syntax is rerun at a later time with the same inputs.</p>

<p>If the variable is a string, <strong>SVALUEROOT</strong> can specify a string to be prefixed
to the new integer values if the string is wide enough.</p>

<p>If <strong>NAMEROOT</strong> is specified, the variables will be renamed to the form
<em>xxxnnn</em>
where <em>xxx</em> is the NAMEROOT value and <em>nnn</em> is an integer.</p>

<h2>SAVE</h2>

<p>The SAVE parameters create text files containing the mapping of variable names,
if any, and old and new values.  The new-values file is in csv format.
The new values are listed alphabetically by the new
value within variable for ease of lookup.  As explained above, the inverse mapping 
is sometimes not unique.</p>

<p>A new-values file can be used as input in a later run by specifying it in
<strong>MAPPING</strong> if the method is SEQUENTIAL or RANDOM.  If given, any variable mappings defined in 
that file are applied to the input values before applying the chosen method.
This means that previously encountered values are mapped the same way
as they were previously.  However, if MAXRVALUE is different or the string
width is different, the results are undefined.</p>

<p>There are side effects to this command.  Value labels and missing value definitions
are cleared, since they no longer apply.  You can anonymize date-format variables, but the
resulting values will usually not display as the values are not in the valid range for dates.
Changing the variable type to numeric will allow the values to display.</p>
